# Invoice Approval Demo App

A small invoice approval app used for live AI-in-SDLC demos. It is deliberately simple: a .NET 8 API, a plain web UI, and an in-memory store, so it runs with one command and no database.

## Run it

```
dotnet run --project backend/src/InvoiceApp.Api
```

Open http://localhost:5000 and sign in:

| User | Password | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `demo.approver` | `ChangeMe123!` | Manager |
| `demo.director` | `ChangeMe123!` | Director |
| `demo.director2` | `ChangeMe123!` | Director |
| `demo.admin` | `ChangeMe123!` | Admin |

These are demo accounts for a local, in-memory app. They are not real credentials.

## What it does

1. Create an invoice (it starts as a draft).
2. Submit it for approval.
3. An approver approves it, or rejects it with a reason.

Invoices move through Draft, Pending Approval, then Approved or Rejected.

## Tests

```
dotnet test backend/InvoiceApp.sln
```

## Project layout

## Use cases

- [UC-1 Bulk invoice approval](docs/use-cases/UC-1-bulk-approval.md)
- [UC-2 Partial approval](docs/use-cases/UC-2-partial-approval.md)

## Approval limits (stage one)

Manager can approve up to 50,000 inclusive; Director can approve up to 500,000 inclusive.
Amounts above 500,000 are safely rejected until the separate dual-approval stage is implemented.
All failed approvals preserve every invoice field. Approval identity and role come only from the authenticated server session.
Admin can reject and delete invoices but cannot approve them. The former Approver demo account is now Manager.

The next stage assumes a Manager or Director may give the first high-value approval and a different Director must give the second. Two Director demo accounts are available for that workflow. The app retains its existing currency display and decimal amounts; data resets on restart.
